Rules: 
How to Play Star Wars Epic Duels Game
These are the rules for the two player game. For more players or tweaks to the main rules also check out the variant rules.

Setup
Each player will choose if they will play as a character from the light or dark side. The game recommends one player play as a character from both sides.
The players will choose which character they would like to play as. They will take the corresponding chart, pawn, minor character pawn(s) and the deck of cards. If you have two of the same minor characters each will be distinguished based on the notches on the base for the rest of the game.
Each player shuffles their deck of cards and places them face down in front of themselves.
The players will decide on which gameboard they would like to play on. The corresponding board will be placed face up on the table.
Each player will place their main character on the space with their name on it.
The players will roll the die. The player who rolls the highest number will start the game. This player will also be the first to place their minor characters. Minor characters can be placed on any space adjacent to their main character as long as it is a valid space.
Each player will take a wound marker for each of the characters that they control. The markers will be placed on the blue circles on the track for each of the characters.
Each player will draw the top four cards from their deck and look at them.
Setup for Star Wars Epic Duels

Playing the Game
A player’s turn consists of two steps.

Roll the die and move characters.
Take two actions.
After a player takes both actions play will pass to the next player clockwise.

Character Movement
Each player begins their turn by rolling the die. The number they roll will determine which character(s) will move and how far they can move. If you roll just a number you will only be able to move one of your characters (your choice). If you roll a side that has “all” and then a number you can move all of your characters up to the number rolled.

Die Roll in Star Wars Epic Duels
This player has rolled an “All Four”. They can move all of their characters up to four spaces.

When moving characters you must follow these rules:

You may move a character forward, backward, or side to side. You may never move a character sideways.
The number you roll is the maximum number of spaces you can move. You can choose to move less spaces or no spaces at all.
A character may never move through or land on fallen pillars, starships, water or mist.
You may never move through an enemy character. You may move through a friendly character though but may not land on the same space as a friendly character.
Performing Actions
After moving their character(s) the player will be able to take two actions. There are three different actions that a player can perform.

Draw a Card
Play a Card
Heal a Character
For your two actions you may perform the same action twice or you may perform two different actions.

Drawing A Card
If you choose to draw a card you will take the top card from your deck and add it to your hand. Each card you draw will count as one action. For example if you draw two cards it will count as two actions.

A player may only have ten cards in their hand at a time. If a player wants to draw a card and they already have ten cards in their hand, they must first discard a card before they draw a new card.

If a player goes through their entire deck of cards they will reshuffle their discard pile to form a new draw deck. If a player goes through their deck a second time the game will immediately end. The players will compare the health of their main characters. The player whose main character has taken less damage will win the game.

Playing A Card
Each card that a player chooses to play will count as one action (unless the card says that it doesn’t count as an action).

There are three types of cards in the game. For more information about combat and power combat cards see the “Combat” section below.

The third type of cards are special cards. These cards will allow you to take special actions. When you play one of these cards you will read the card and take the corresponding action. Once the action has been taken the card will be discarded.

Special Card in Star Wars Epic Duels
This is a special card. When played this card will deal six damage to a minor character.

Combat
In Star Wars Epic Duels there are two types of combat.

For melee combat the attacking player must be on a space adjacent to the character they are fighting.

Melee Combat in Star Wars Epic Duels
Darth Vader is on a space next to Leia. Therefore Darth Vader can attack Leia.

Characters with a blaster next to their picture on the character chart also have access to ranged combat. A character can attack with a ranged attack if you can draw a straight line (in any direction including diagonal) between their position and the position of their target. This line between the two characters cannot be interrupted by obstacles (fallen pillars, starship) or other characters.

Ranged Combat in Star Wars Epic Duels
Leia is a ranged character in the game. In her current position she can attack the back Stormtrooper and Darth Vader because there is a straight line between them and Leia. Leia cannot shoot the closer Stormtrooper because you cannot draw a straight line between their current positions.

When a player wants to initiate melee or ranged combat they will have to play a combat or power combat card. To attack with a character you must play a combat card featuring the same character. Each combat card will feature an attack and a defend number. The attack number is how much damage the card can do. The defense number is how much protection the card offers. When you want to attack you will announce which character is attacking and which character they are targeting. The attacking player will then place a combat card face down on the table.

Attack in Star Wars Epic Duels
The Darth Vader player has decided to attack. They have played this card for their attack (face down).

The player that is being attacked then has the option of defending. To play a defense card the player must play a card with a picture matching the character being attacked. They can either play a combat or a power combat card for the defensive value. Playing a card defensively is optional as the player can choose not to play a card.

Defending in Star Wars Epic Duels
As Luke was being attacked the player has decided to play this Luke card for defense. As the Darth Vader card had an attack of four and the Luke card had a defense of three Darth Vader will deal one point of damage to Luke.

Once both players have had the option of playing a card they will reveal the cards that they have played. If the defend value is higher or equal to the attack value nothing happens. If the attack value is higher than the defend value though the attacking character will do damage to the other character equal to the difference between the attack and defend numbers. The attacked character will move the marker on their character chart one space towards the red circle for each point of damage taken.  In either case all played cards will be discarded.

Damage in Star Wars Epic Duels
One point of damage was done to Luke so they will move the marker on his section of the board one space towards the red mark.

Power combat cards are basically the same as combat cards except they don’t always have both an attack and defend number. The cards have a special effect printed on the bottom of the cards which will go into effect after determining damage. If both the attacker and defender use power combat cards the attacker’s effects will apply first.

Power Combat Card in Star Wars Epic Duels
This is a power combat card for Darth Vader. It has an attack of three. The card will also heal Darth Vader up to the amount of damage he deals to another player.

Healing A Character
The final action that a player can take is healing your main character. Once you have lost your minor character(s) you can use their cards in order to heal your main character. A character that has been destroyed cannot be healed. For each minor character card that you discard you will heal your main character of one point of damage by moving the marker one space towards the blue circle. Each card that is discarded will count as one action.

Healing in Star Wars Epic Duels
As both of the Stormtroopers have been destroyed the player can use this card to heal one of Darth Vader’s health points.

When a character’s damage marker moves to the red circle the character is destroyed/killed. The character’s pawn will be removed from the gameboard and cannot return to the game.

End of Game
When a player loses their main character they are eliminated from the game. The other player will win the game.


Characters




Anakin & Padme:

Minor(s): Padme
What does this deck do:  WRATHS opposing minors.  Threatens with heavy hitting ranged minor.  Duels with offense and defense.

Anakin Skywalker
Original, unmodified Epic Duels deck by Rob Daviau and Craig Van Ness
Anakin Skywalker
18 HP
Melee
19 Cards
Red Deck

Padme Amidala
10 HP
Ranged
12 Cards

Strong Ranged Minor Deck

Anakin – 9 Talent Cards

3x WRATH
Move to any minor character, inflict 7 damage

2x ANGER
A8; discard all but 1

2x COUNTERATTACK
No damage from attack; Attacker loses 1HP

2x CALM
Move 8, draw 5 if hand is empty

Padme – 3 Talent Cards

1x PRECISE SHOT
A9; discard 1 to draw 1

1x SHOT ON THE RUN
A6, move 6

1x PROTECTION
Padme recovers 4HP if Anankin is alive; 2HP if he’s dead

Why not tweak Anakin?  We’ve always felt this was one of the best-designed decks, as it is aggressive and has cards that represent its characters very well in both character and effect.  This is the deck I’ve seen tweaked the least in my experience, and just about everyone likes it the way it is.

Themes: Wrath, Anger, and Calm
Path to Victory: ANGER + CALM or ANGER + ANGER
Strengths: High attacks, big ranged attacks, solid defense, outstanding killing power vs minors, strong minor
Weaknesses: Needs to get his cards in the right order, mediocre defense
Strategy: WRATH and Padme early, ANGER and CALM late.
Tier: 2

Notes: This is probably the least-tweaked deck I’ve seen through the Epic Duels Online Community and anywhere Epic Duels is played.  Maybe, just maybe, someone once proposed making WRATH usable in some way against majors, but it’s otherwise the one deck everyone leaves alone.  Everyone agrees that its strength in both 1v1 and 2v2 is about average, it doesn’t have any broken or negative play experience cards, and the cards fit the characters very well.  We’ve probably always liked Anakin a little more than most others, and have had him ranked among the top of Tier 2 decks in the past before settling him more into the middle as we do now.  Anakin relies upon getting his cards in the right order more than other characters, but when he does, he has a higher ceiling than many Tier 2 decks with his A8s and Padme’s A9 along with a potential game-changer in WRATH in the Geektopia set, where there are many more important, named minors.  Any major with a Red deck will have a low floor, and Anakin is no exception.


Obiwan & Clones:

Minor(s): 2 Clone Troopers

What does this deck do:  Tanks better than anyone else.  Hits and runs.  Balances it up.

“Obi-Wan Jedi Knight”
Modified deck. Original Epic Duels deck by Rob Daviau and Craig Van Ness. Modifications by Geektopia.

Obi-Wan Kenobi
18 HP
Melee
22 Cards
Blue Deck

2x Clone Troopers
4 HP Each
Blaster
Weak Ranged Minor Deck
9 Cards

Obi-Wan – 12 Talent Cards

3x JEDI ATTACK
A6, move 6.

3x JEDI BLOCK
D12, draw a card.

2x FORCE CONTROL
A5, move Obi & attacked character 3 spaces each.

2x FORCE QUICKNESS
Move 8, draw a card.

1x JEDI MIND TRICK
Take a card from your discard pile.

1x FORCE BALANACE
All players discard hands and draw 3 cards.

Why Tweak Obi-Wan? To make him weaker. Obi-Wan was by far the best character in the original set to the point of being imbalanced, and in 2v2, FORCE CONTROL was a ridiculous game-changing card. Obi-Wan, as of Episode 2, was strong but clearly not yet among the elite Jedi.

Tweaks:

Tweak 2x FORCE CONTROL to A5, move Obi-Wan and attacked character up to 3 spaces.

Themes: Balance, hit-and-run
Path to Victory: DEFEND + DEFEND + ATTACK + ATTACK + RUN AWAY, repeat — you do this better than just about everyone else
Strengths: Great defense, movement, and hit-and-run
Weaknesses: Mediocre damage output with no direct damage, weak minors
Strategy: Control the game with great movement and defense, chip away on offense.
Test Level: High
Tier: 1

Notes: He’s the original sluggo with large amounts of power attacks and power defense. However, the tweak reduces the game-changing power of FORCE CONTROL and reduces his offensive output to a mediocre level.  Still, the deck retains its characteristic great defense, resulting in more of a “tank” deck with great defense but limited offense, very strong but no longer among the strongest decks of the game, more like 1B than 1A.  This is where we think he should be.  With reduced attack power, Obi-Wan has to make good use of his hit-and-run abilities and FORCE BALANCE.  Still, nobody can tank or seal off part of the board like Obi-Wan, making him a top 2v2 teammate.

Mace Windu & Clones:

Minor(s): 2 Clone Troopers

What does this deck do:  Direct damage to crowds.  Powers up as it draws cards, and draws a lot of cards.

“Master Windu”
Modified deck. Original Epic Duels deck by Rob Daviau and Craig Van Ness. Modifications by Geektopia.

Mace Windu
19 HP
Melee
22 Cards
Blue Deck

2x Clone Troopers
4 HP Each
Blaster
9 Cards
Weak Ranged Minor Deck

Mace – 12 Talent Cards
4x BATTLEMIND
A*/D;* * = number of cards in hand after Battlemind is played

4x MASTERFUL FIGHTING
A6, draw a card

2x WHIRLWIND ATTACK
Inflict 4 damage to any enemy Mace can attack

2x WISDOM
Move 5, draw 1

Why Tweak Mace? To make him stronger. Geektopia considers Mace the strongest duelist in the 6 movies, yet in the original SWED set, Mace is only an average deck.

Tweaks:

Replace 2x WISDOM with 2x MASTERFUL FIGHTING
Then, tweak 4x MASTERFUL FIGHTING from A5 to A6

Theme: Grows in strength as the battle goes on
Path to Victory: Draw to a full hand then BATTLEMIND + BATTLEMIND
Strengths: Balanced with the potential for strong attacks and strong defense, high direct damage
Weaknesses: Susceptible to opponents that make him discard or play a low-card game, weak minors
Strategy: Build up a big hand to become the strongest fighter on the battle field.
Test Level: High
Tier: 1

Notes: Same old Mace, just stronger. Tweaks boost his strength from an average deck to a sluggo that can combat the toughest foes with ample amounts of power attacks and power defense. The price is less movement, but most games, it is well worth the trade. He might be the best 1-on-1 melee fighter in the game, which was the goal.

Yoda & Clones:

Minor(s): 2 Clone Troopers
“I came up with the Yoda deck first.  If you notice, the Yoda deck is kind of the funkiest.  It’s a little quirky.  So we kind of used that to test, but then we realized, it should be simpler, probably a little more streamlined, but we never had the time to go back and streamline the Yoda deck.  So it kind of is like the prototype deck that got published.  So when I play the game I’m like, ‘This one is still a bit fussy.'” — Rob Daviau, creator of Star Wars Epic Duels

We created the Yoda, Defender of Kashyyk deck to better capture the whirling, leaping swordsman we saw in Episodes II-III.  This one was then modified to make it more competitive, and really better reflects the Yoda of the later trilogy, not the fighter he once was but still a powerful force.

What does this deck do:  Tanks.  Neutralizes enemies.  Reverses your attack against you.

“Master Yoda”
Modified deck. Original Epic Duels deck by Rob Daviau and Craig Van Ness (but I guess really just Rob)
Modifications by Geektopia

Yoda
15 HP
Melee
22 Cards
Green Deck

2x Clone Troopers
4 HP Each
Blaster
9 Cards
Weak Ranged Minor Deck

Yoda – 12 Talent Cards

3x FORCE LIFT
Turn any character on his side. While on his side, that character cannot move, attack or defend until the player controlling that character discards 3 cards to stand that character up.

2x INSIGHT
Look at opponent’s hand, and choose one card for discard.

2x FORCE STRIKE
A8. Draw a card.

2x SERENITY
D15. Draw a card.

2x FORCE PUSH
Move any adjacent character to any space, that character takes 3 damage.

1x FORCE REBOUND
D*. Yoda takes no damage. Attacker takes damage instead of Yoda.

Why Tweak Yoda? Rob Daviau calls him “a little fussy”.  We find him a little underpowered for a character of his stature (though solidly Tier 2 overall) but a tad annoying due to his lack of movement.  IanA Yoda player can really get shut down by bad dice rolling, so we’ve made some tweaks to alleviate that.

Tweaks:

Tweak 3x FORCE LIFT to allow Yoda to choose any character, not just an adjacent character, and to allow only the affected player to discard 3 cards, not any player.

Tweak 2x FORCE STRIKE from A6 to A8.

Themes: Defense and control
Path to Victory: Hold them off with defense, then FORCE LIFT + FORCE STRIKE
Strengths: High defense, forces opponents to discard, FORCE PUSH
Weaknesses: Low damage output, no movement, weak minors
Strategy: Use great defense to get into battle, use INSIGHT and FORCE PUSH to control the board.
Test Level: High
Tier: 2

Notes: The tweak to FORCE LIFT reduces the liability of lack of movement and the tweak to FORCE STRIKE raises his power level by giving him more punch.  With those major problems addressed, Yoda actually borders on being fun to play.


Han Solo & Chewbacca:

Minor(s): Chewbacca
“I like how Chewie feels like a major character,” — Rob Daviau, creator of Epic Duels in 2018.  No arguments here.

What does this deck do:  One huge attack that it tries to recycle.  A bit of direct damage, hit and run, and forced discarding.

Han Solo
Original, unmodified Epic Duels deck by Rob Daviau and Craig Van Ness

Han Solo
13 HP
Blaster
17 Cards
Yellow+ Deck

Chewbacca
15 HP
Blaster
14 Cards
Strong+ Ranged Minor Deck

Han – 7 Talent Cards

3 x GAMBLER’S LUCK
A4; opponent discards a card at random

2 x HEROIC RETREAT
A5; move Han 5

2 x NEVER TELL ME THE ODDS
2 damage to all players Han can attack; shuffle discard pile into deck

Chewbacca – 5 Talent Cards

2 x IT’S NOT WISE…
Move an adjacent enemy 3 spaces; that character takes 3 damage

1 x BOWCASTER ATTACK
A11, draw a card

1 x WOOKIE INSTINCTS
Find the Bowcaster card and place it in your hand; reshuffle your deck

1 x WOOKIE HEALING
Heal 3, move 5

Why not tweak Han? We’ve always found this deck to be fun and unique while featuring 2 of our favorite characters at the level of power we feel is appropriate for them. They’re weak compared to Jedi type decks, but shouldn’t they be? In Geektopia that answer is yes.

Themes: Tag-team buddies, luck, never out of it
Path to Victory: BOWCASTER + NEVER TELL ME THE ODDS + WOOKIE INSTINCTS then repeat
Strengths: BOWCASTER, strong minor, forced discarding, ability to reshuffle best cards back into deck
Weaknesses: Weak offense outside of BOWCASTER, major has very low staying power
Strategy: Keep enemies off you by switching up who’s in front. Try to get BOWCASTER out of Chewie and reshuffle, but remember that Han is the key to the deck.
Tier: 3

Notes: This was in many ways the most clever design of the original decks by Daviau and Van Ness. It not only has a neat combo in WOOKIE INSTINCTS + BOWCASTER + NEVER TELL ME THE ODDS, but the combination of NTMTO with GAMBLER’S LUCK also means that even without the mighty Chewbacca at his side, Han always has a chance to win by recycling his best cards and denying his opponent of his best cards. This deck tends to benefit from 2v2 play, where Chewie at least poses a threat and absorbs a lot of damage even if Han has been destroyed. It also sets a lot of limits of deck design — 28 hit points is the most of any deck, along with Dooku, yet 13 HP is the fewest of any major, along with Palpatine and Yoda. Chewbacca’s BOWCASTER basically sets the attack limit at 11. Han shows some flexing of the Yellow deck for more defense, Chewie flexes the strong ranged minor deck for more offense. It’s almost like all the tweaks needed for this deck were already made.

Luke & Leia:

Minor(s): Leia Organa

What does this deck do:  Takes your attack cards away.  Powers up when Leia is dead.

“Luke & Leia”
Modified deck. Original Epic Duels deck by Rob Daviau and Craig Van Ness. Modifications by Geektopia.

Luke Skywalker
17 HP
Melee
18 Cards
Red Deck

Princess Leia Organa
10 HP
Blaster
13 Cards
Strong Ranged Minor Deck

Luke – 8 Talent Cards

3x I WILL NOT FIGHT YOU
Luke and opponent both show hands and discard any card with an attack value greater than 1.

3x CHILDREN OF THE FORCE
Move Luke and Leia 6 spaces each, draw 2

2x JUSTICE
A6; A10 if Leia is dead.

Leia – 4 Talent Cards

2x LUKE’S IN TROUBLE
Leia moves adjacent to Luke, Luke recovers 4HP; if dead, Leia recovers 4HP.

2x LATENT FORCE ABILITIES
A7/D7; draw a card.

Why Tweak Luke? To make him slightly stronger but mostly less annoying. Luke & Leia are mostly a great design but when they don’t get their cards in the right order they are pathetically weak. Luke has always had low staying power, and once people figured out not to kill Leia, he lost his primary path to victory. We don’t really mess with his deck, just boost it a bit and add more of a dilemma as to whether or not to kill Leia.

Tweaks:

Tweak 2x JUSTICE from A4 to A6; still A10 if Leia is destroyed.
Tweak 2x LUKE’S IN TROUBLE to: Move Leia adjacent to Luke, Luke recovers 4 damage, Leia recovers 4 damage if Luke is destroyed.

Theme: Alternates between being passive and angry
Path to Victory: LATENT FORCE ABILITIES + Leia’s death + JUSTICE
Strengths: Forces opponents to discard, potentially big attacks, solid movement, strong minor
Weaknesses: Poor defense, potentially mediocre attacks, needs to get cards in the right order.
Strategy: Use I WILL NOT FIGHT YOU to control opponents, use Leia’s offense early and finish up with JUSTICE.
Test Level: Very High
Tier: 2

Notes: Original Luke’s I WILL NOT FIGHT YOU is already much more powerful in a 2v2 game, where your partner can take advantage of a foe weakened by it, and it remains the key to Luke’s effectiveness.  He can be a great teammate but also suffers from bouts of insignificance.  The boost to JUSTICE makes it useful when Leia’s alive, and the boost to LUKE’S IN TROUBLE boosts Luke’s staying power while increasing Leia’s overall value to where it is actually a difficult decision of whether or not to kill her.

Jango Fett & Zam:

Minor(s): Zam Wessell

What does this deck do:  Hits and runs and teams up.  Great movement with enough offense to bother you.

“Jango & Zam”
Modified deck. Original Epic Duels deck by Rob Daviau and Craig Van Ness. Modifications by Geektopia.

Jango Fett
15 HP
Blaster
18 cards
Yellow Deck

Zam Wessel
10 HP
Blaster
13 Cards
Strong Ranged Minor Deck

Jango – 8 Talent Cards

3x ROCKET RETREAT
A4; move Jango anywhere.

2x WRIST CABLE
2 damage; opponent loses one action on next turn.

1x MISSILE LAUNCH
A7, draw 3 cards – draw 4 on Kamino Platform.

1x KAMINO SABER DART
A9; draw 3 cards if enemy is destroyed.

1x FIRE UP THE JETPACK
Move anywhere; doesn’t count as an action.

Zam – 4 Talent Cards

3x SNIPER SHOT
A3*. SNIPER SHOT does double any damage.

1x ASSASSINATION
A7; move Zam anywhere.

Why tweak Jango? To make him stronger. Jango is by far the weakest 2v2 deck in the original set. Good movement doesn’t make up for weak offense and weak defense. We find the whole “if not blocked” concept in Zam’s SNIPER SHOT to be largely ineffective. Overall, the original version doesn’t have much going for it and isn’t much fun, these tweaks give it a little more bite.

TWEAKS

Replace:

1x FLAMETHROWER

With:

1x KAMINO SABER DART
A9, draw 3 cards if target is destroyed

Then:

Tweak 3x SNIPER SHOT to: A3*, SNIPER SHOT does double any damage.

Theme: A pair of fast, hard-hitting bounty hunters
Path to Victory: ROCKET LAUNCH + KAMINO SABER DART
Strengths: High attacks, high movement, strong minor
Weaknesses: Low staying power, attack power is spread across 2 characters
Strategy: Use movement to keep the distance and rotate Jango and Zam to keep both alive
Test Level: Very High
Tier: 3

Notes: Tweaks don’t make them much stronger, but they give Jango another big attack and Zam a bit more punch, that’s enough to contribute to a win here and there, which is better than they used to do.  Jango still has low overall staying power and has to rely on his considerable movement abilities and Zam, who’s damage output is a little better. Jango loses his signature Flamethrower but he doesn’t really miss it.

Darth Vader & Stormtroopers:

Minor(s): 2 Stormtroopers
“Yeah, Vader gets the most debate.  I can see that.  I mean, if you don’t know about ALL TOO EASY, he’s overpowered in one way.  If you know about it, he’s too weak,” — Rob Daviau, creator of Star Wars Epic Duels, in 2018.



What does this deck do:  Wipes the board of minors plus lots of direct damage and one big attack.

“Sith Lord Vader”
Modified deck. Original Epic Duels deck by Rob Daviau and Craig Van Ness. Modifications by Geektopia.

Darth Vader
20 HP
Melee
22 Cards
Red Deck

2x Stormtroopers
4 HP Each
Blaster
9 Cards
Weak Ranged Minor Deck

Vader – 12 Talent Cards

3x WRATH
Choose one character’s players to each take 2 damage.

3x CHOKE
Choose one minor character to take 6 damage.

2x THROW DEBRIS
Choose one character to take 4 damage.

2x DARK SIDE DRAIN
A5. For each point of damage done with this attack, Vader recovers 1 damage.

1x ALL TOO EASY
A9*. *If this attack is not blocked, attack value is 20.

1x YOUR SKILLS ARE NOT COMPLETE
Choose a player to reveal his hand and discard all Special cards.

Why tweak Vader?  Because once you know about ALL TOO EASY, he’s too weak.  This has been discussed ad nauseum in most places Epic Duels is discussed but mainly, he’s a very weak player in 1v1 and even though he’s much more valuable in 2v2, he still comes up short of our expectations of such a character, especially as a melee fighter. These tweaks make him a much tougher lightsaber combatant and result in a stronger, more fun overall deck.

Tweaks:

Tweak 2x DARK SIDE DRAIN from A3 to A5.
Tweak 1x ALL TOO EASY from A3* to A9*, still 20 damage if not blocked.

No YOUR SKILLS ARE NOT COMPLETE tweak? It’s such a common tweak that it needs to be addressed: A majority of Geektopia doesn’t want to see Vader with that sort of YOU WILL DIE-like control over the game. We like the card the way it is.

Theme: Powerful direct damage dealer with some melee ability
Path to Victory: Combine direct damage cards and finish with ALL TOO EASY
Strengths: High direct damage that gets to opponents anywhere, kills minors anywhere, high HP
Weaknesses: No card drawing power, poor defense, weak minors
Strategy: Throw direct damage from a distance, save your big melee cards for when they close in.
Test Level: Medium
Tier: 2

Notes: This very simple tweak scheme provides Vader with a solid melee game, which we think is more representative of his movie persona, and additional staying power, which he badly needs.  Original Vader powers up in a 2v2 game as CHOKE and WRATH have more targets and THROW DEBRIS is a great move to follow up an ally’s attack, but his lack of staying power keeps him among the weaker decks.  This tweaked version plays a solid Tier 2 in our experience.  This tweak scheme comes after years of replacing half the deck with power combat cards and a powered-up YOUR SKILLS ARE NOT COMPLETE, as we are now choosing instead to return him to his direct damage theme.

Darth Maul & Battle Droids:

What does this deck do:  Dispenses unmatched single turn damage output with many attacks, and strong ones.  Hits and runs.

Darth Maul
Original, unmodified Epic Duels deck by Rob Daviau and Craig Van Ness.

Darth Maul
18 HP
Melee
22 Cards
Red Deck

2x Battle Droids
3 HP Each
Blaster
9 Cards
Weak Ranged Minor Deck

Darth Maul – 12 Talent Cards

3 x SITH SPEED
A3; doesn’t count as an action.

3 x SUPER SITH SPEED
A4; doesn’t count as an action.

3 x ATHLETIC SURGE
A8; move 6 spaces.

2 x BLINDING SURGE
D0; Attacker takes 3 damage points.

1 x MARTIAL DEFENSE
D10; draw 1 card

Why not tweak Maul?  We’ve just always liked Maul where he is, and for what he is. Different than many online reports I’ve read, we’ve never found the original Maul to be a Tier 1 deck, not with his weak defense and weak minors.  We actually think the design is brilliant in how it breaks all rules in turns of damage output, both total and single-turn, but yet has enough weaknesses to make it beatable.

Themes: Furious attacker, hit-and-run
Path to Victory: Multiple SITH SPEED/SUPER SITH SPEED cards followed by ATHLETIC SURGE
Strengths: Unmatched single-turn killing power, high attacks, hit-and-run
Weaknesses: Poor defense, very weak minors
Strategy: Stay back and stockpile, then unload and run away, wash and repeat.
Tier: 2A

Notes: Maul remains the game’s most dangerous character, capable of unparalleled single-turn damage output. That stated, since the earliest days of playing Epic Duels without any tweaks or custom decks or anything like that, we’ve seen Maul’s limitations. A dominant character in 1v1, Maul is hindered more in 2v2 by his lack of movement and defense.  Those, along with the weakest minors in the game, leaves Maul coming up short as a teammate vs. other Tier 1 decks. That stated, Maul tops nearly all Tier 2 decks with his unmatched damage output and undisputed ability to outright kill other characters, or dominate games with hit-and-run when everything (including the dice) works in concert for him.

Count Doku & Super Battle Droids:
Minor(s): 2 Super Battle Droids
“We never liked Dooku’s pose. We always called him ‘I’m a little teapot’,” — Rob Daviau, creator of Epic Duels, in 2018. 

What does this deck do:  Taunts, Force pushes and deals lightning.

“Darth Tyranus”
Modified deck. Original Epic Duels deck by Rob Daviau and Craig Van Ness. Modifications by Geektopia.

Count Dooku
18 HP
Melee
22 Cards
Blue Deck

2x Super Battle Droids
5 HP Each
Blaster
9 Cards
Strong+ Ranged Minor Deck

Dooku – 12 Talent Cards

4 x TAUNTING
A7; draw 1 card

2 x GIVE ORDERS
Move all units up to 4 spaces each. Draw a card.

2 x FORCE PUSH
Inflict 2 damage; move target anywhere.

2 x GAIN POWER
Draw 3 cards

2 x DARK LIGHTNING
Inflict 3 damage to anyone on board; victim must discard 1 card

Why tweak Dooku?  Despite being one of the better-balanced of the original Epic Duels decks, Dooku’s deck didn’t really reflect what we saw from the character in Episode 2. Although Dooku certainly wasn’t a weak deck, his deck strength didn’t live up to his formidable movie persona and his movement and direct damage cards were weaker than everyone else’s. Also, since the deck was written before the movie came out, the signature component of LIGHTNING had been left out of his deck. All of this has been remedied to this version, a low Tier 1 deck, right where we want him.

Tweaks:

Replace:

1x FORCE DRAIN
1x GIVE ORDERS 

With:

2x DARK LIGHTNING: Inflict 3 damage to one character; controlling player must choose and discard 1 card.

Then:

Tweak 2x GIVE ORDERS cards by adding “draw a card”.
Tweak 2x FORCE PUSH by increasing the damage from 1 to 2.

Themes: Power and taunting
Path to Victory: Use your draw power to get all 4 TAUNTINGs, mix in with direct damage
Strengths: High attacks, high direct damage, high card-drawing power, force push, strong minors
Weaknesses: Mediocre defense
Strategy: Draw cards and use minors early to buy time for Dooku to draw multiple TAUNTINGS
Test Level: Very High
Tier: 1B

Notes:  Dooku is probably our favorite deck to play mostly because of the way we play the TAUNTING card: You must verbally taunt the character or player you are attacking in order to draw a card. Any taunt of the character or player will do, even a simple “Ha, ha, you disappoint me!” or “Surely you can do better,” but this rule has resulted in our depicting Dooku as cross between a 19th century Southern plantation owner and a 6th century Roman Senator.  Also, it bears mentioning that a strong Dooku is a fun Dooku.  It’s good to have some tough, lightsaber-wielding bad guys who can duel all the heroic dueling Jedi decks we’ve made.

The tweaked Dooku deck is a versatile, top-tier teammate. Dooku admittedly misses FORCE DRAIN but when did he do that in the movie anyways? Dooku now has his signature lightning, considerable direct damage and even more card-drawing power to go along with those 4 TAUNTINGS.  FORCE PUSH and DARK SIDE LIGHTNING are a nasty combination for isolating and damaging an opponent, and his ability to inflict direct damage from any distance makes him an outstanding teammate, along with his strong minors.  Only his lack of power defense prevents him from being one of the very strongest decks..

We actually experimented for a while by giving Dooku a Green deck to make him a little stronger but he actually missed the Blue deck’s A5s and it was interesting to see that a Green deck in his case really wasn’t much better than a Blue.  He might have been a smidge better overall with a Green deck but he’s top tier with Blue, and it keeps Green reserved for true Masters like Yoda/Sidious/Plaguies, as we don’t think Dooku fits that category.

Emperor & Royal Guards:

Minor(s): 2 Royal Guards

What does this deck do:  Makes you discard your entire hand with YOU WILL DIE, plus direct damage, forced discards, and denies drawing of cards.

 
Emperor Palpatine
Original, unmodified Epic Duels deck by Rob Daviau and Craig Van Ness

Emperor Palpatine
13 HP
Melee
22 Cards
Green Deck

2x Royal Guards
5 HP Each
Blaster
9 Cards
Strong++ Ranged Minor Deck

Emperor Palpatine – 12 Talent Cards

4x FORCE LIGHTNING
Inflict 3 damage to anyone on board; victim must discard 1 card at random.

2x MEDITATION
Heal 4 HP; select one opponent to not draw on his or her next turn.

2x FUTURE FORESEEN
Draw 4; place 3 back on top of deck in any order.

2x LET GO OF YOUR HATRED
Force opponent to discard 2 cards of his or her choice.

1x YOU WILL DIE
Force opponent to discard entire hand

1x ROYAL COMMAND
Swap places with one crimson guard

Why not tweak Emperor?  We’ve always found this deck to be at the right level of power — which is to say, very high — for the character it represents.  There are more powerful decks in the Geektopia universe but only a few, and none carry a card that terrorizes like YOU WILL DIE.  While we know there are many Epic Duelists who dislike the all-or-nothing, negative play experience of YOU WILL DIE, it has always been fun for us.  We’re always looking for decks that discourage sitting around and drawing cards, and this one has always played that role in our set.  We think this deck is one of the best-designed, though we sometimes discuss tweaking or replacing ROYAL COMMAND, the game’s least useful card, with something more useful, but we probably never will.

Theme: Resource-denial
Path to Victory: YOU WILL DIE + MEDITATION followed by multiple FORCE LIGHTNING and/or LET GO OF YOUR HATRED
Strengths: YOU WILL DIE, incredible resource-denying ability, high direct damage, affects enemies from anywhere on the board, strong minors
Weaknesses: Low overall killing power, low movement, no power defense
Strategy: Do damage from a distance with LIGHTNING and Royal Guards until you can use YOU WILL DIE, then keep doing damage and denying resources until they’re dead.
Tier: 1

Notes: Even though we’ve created some powerful decks and some neat designs, Emperor Palpatine remains one of the strongest, and one of the best overall designs. That stated, his lack of damage output just keeps him from being toe-to-toe with the top sluggos unless he gets YOU WILL DIE and plays it at the right time, followed by a string of resource-denying cards.

Lord of the Rings Epic Duels Decks:

Witch King of Angmar:
Minor(s): 2 Orc Archers
Back to LOTRED

This is a fun, powerful deck, but considering how strong the Aragorn and Gandalf decks are, maybe it should be even stronger!

THE WITCH KING OF ANGMAR

Witch King
19 HP
Blue Deck (10 cards, melee)

2 Orc Archers
4 HP
Weak Ranged Minor Deck (9 cards, ranged)

Witch King Talent Cards (12)

3x Great Black Flail
A4, After attack is resolved, GREAT BLACK FLAIL does 2 damage to all enemies Witch King can attack.

2x Sword of Flame
A5, If the Witch King does damage with this card, the player controlling the defending character must choose and discard cards equal to the amount of damage done, up to 3.

2x No Man Can Kill Me
D*. If the attacking character is female, this card has no defense value against Power Combat cards. Otherwise, Witch King receives no damage from the attack.

1x Morgul Blade
A5, If this attack does damage, place a MORGUL BLADE MARKER on the defending character’s character sheet.

2x Terrifying Screech
Pick 2 cards at random from an opponent’s hand. That player must discard those cards.  All characters with a MORGUL BLADE MARKER receive 3 damage.

2x Fell Swoop
You may move Witch King adjacent to any character. That character receives 2 damage.

Notes:  With hindsight, I probably give him 20 HP, but this is fine.  He’s got great staying power.  His offense is just ok, with SWORD OF FLAME capped at a 3 card discard, but it can be a NPE (negative play experience) to say, have your minor get hit for 4 points of damage, and discard 4 cards along with that.

Uruk-hai Army:
Minor(s): 2 Uruk-hai Warriors
Back to LOTRED

Another unconventional, yet effective design, this one with 2 majors and 2 minors.  All the credit for this one goes to Robert Moore, who had done something similar with a Nute Gunray & Haako deck.

URUK-HAI ARMY

Uruk-Hai Commander
8 HP
Shared Red Deck (Melee, 10 cards)

Uruk-Hai Berserker
8 HP
Shared Red Deck (Melee, 10 cards)

2x Uruk Warriors
5 HP each
Minor Blue Deck (Melee, 9 cards)

Uruk Commander – 8 Talent Cards

3x URUK HAI ASSAULT
A6. After attacking, the Uruk Hai Commander may exchange places with any character in the Uruk Hai Army.

3x TO WAR
Move all allied Uruk Hai on the board up to 4 spaces each. Draw a card.

1x KNOW NO PAIN
D*
*The Uruk-hai Commander takes 1 damage from the attack. Draw a card.

1x SEND IN THE SAPPERS
Choose any open space the Commander could attack at range. All characters adjacent to that space take 3 damage and cannot move on their next turn.

Uruk Berserker – 4 Talent Cards

2x BLOODLUST
A7. After attacking you must discard a card at random. Then draw a card.

1x BRED TO DIE
A9. If the target of this attack is not destroyed, the Berserker is destroyed.

1x SUICIDE MISSION
The Berserker does 4 damage to all adjacent characters and himself.

Notes:  A fun and unique yet balanced deck, let us know what you think!

Sharku:
This was going to be part of the original set and eventually came out as part of the Armies expansion.  It’s all the same now really, and this is a really fun deck.

SHARKU AND 2 WARG RIDERS

Sharku
14 HP
Red Deck (10 cards, melee)

2 Warg Riders
6 HP
Minor Blue Deck (9 cards, melee)

Sharku Talent Cards (12)

4x Taunt
A6. Draw a card.

4x Ambush
Move Sharku up to 5 spaces.  Then move Warg Rider 1 up to 5 spaces and move Warg Rider 2 up to
5 spaces.  Draw a card for each Warg Rider that has not been destroyed.

2x Warg Bite
Sharku or either Warg Rider do 3 damage to one opponent’s character they can attack.

1x Howl
Choose an opponent. That opponent chooses and discards 2 cards and loses an action on his/her next turn.

1x Tumble
D0*, *Before taking the attacker’s damage, Sharku does damage to the attacking character equal
to the value of the attack card.  If the attacking character is destroyed, Sharku receives no damage from the attack.

Notes:  This is a fun deck because it just sort of moves and attacks.  If you’re going with 12 decks, I recommend this one over Gothmog.

Saruman:
Minor(s): Grima Wormtongue
Back to LOTRED

This deck turned out really well, especially once we added THE WAY OF PAIN.

SARUMAN AND GRIMA WORMTONGUE

Saruman
15 HP
Green Deck (10 cards, melee)

Grima
10 HP
Minor Brown Deck (9 cards, melee)

Saruman Talent Cards (9)

3x Saruman’s Voice
Choose any opponent. Move each of that opponent’s characters up to 4 spaces.  Draw a card.

2x Staff of Power
Move any character adjacent to Saruman to any empty space. That character receives 3 damage.

2x Fireball
FIREBALL does 3 damage to any one character Saruman can attack at range. All characters adjacent to that character also receive 3 damage, and the players controlling affected characters must choose and discard a card.

1x Way of Pain
Choose an opposing character adjacent to Saruman. Player controlling that character reveals his hand and discards all defense cards greater than 1 for the chosen character.

1x Palantír
Look at the top 5 cards of your draw pile.  Put 2 in your hand and put the other 3 cards back on top of your draw pile in any order.

Grima Talent Cards (3)

2x Leechcraft
Choose an opponent with a character adjacent to Grima. That opponent chooses
and discards 3 cards.

1x Betrayal
A7*: *If you do not destroy the defending character with this card, Saruman receives 4 damage.

Notes:  While this deck is sufficiently strong, in a general LOTR theme, I’m not sure it can quite keep up with the Tier 1 good guys it’s supposed to keep up with, namely Gandalf and Aragorn.  But, there’s no question he’s a tough deck.  If Grima can drain you with his LEECHCRAFT, it’s pretty hard to beat them.

The Nazgul:
Minor(s): 2 Nazgul
Back to LOTRED

This design is really unconventional, yet it totally works!  This might serve as a model for decks with 3 major characters.

3 Nazgul – All are considered major characters
8 HP Each
Blue Major + Weak Melee Minor (Melee; shared by all 3 Nazgul – Geektopia Melee Minor deck)

2x A5D1
1x A4D1
2x A4D2
2x A3D3
1x A2D3
2x A1D4
3x A3D1
4x A2D2
2x A1D3

Nazgul Talent Cards (12, all shared):

3x KNIVES IN THE DARK
A4*. *Attack value is increased by 2 for each of your Nazgul adjacent to the defending character besides the attacker.

2x DEATH GRIP
A6. If the defending character takes damage from this attack, that character may not move on his/her next turn.

3x FELL STEEDS
Move each Nazgul up to 5 spaces. Draw a card.

2x BLACK BREATH 
All opposing characters adjacent to any Nazgul takes 3 damage. Each affected opponent discards a card at random.

2x NEITHER LIVING NOR DEAD
D5*. Increase the defense value by 1 for each Nazgul adjacent to the defender. If the attacking character is female, the defense value of this card is 0.

Notes:  You just have to play it because it isn’t like anything else, but FreakyMutantMan has remarked that his group has a lot of fun with this deck.  Also, Robert’s battle card for them is a work of art in itself.  I’m only not sure if I should allow them to all be minors, or if they should all be majors, but probably not both.  For now, consider them all majors, not subject to minor-affecting cards like Theoden’s HERUGRIM.

Lurtz:
Minor(s): 2 Uruk-hai Crossbowmen
Back to LOTRED

This was an easy deck to do, because megaswfan came up with such a good design, and we just kind of stuck with it.

LURTZ

Lurtz
15 HP
Orange Deck (10 cards, ranged)

2 Uruk-hai Crossbowmen
5 HP each
Minor Orange deck (9 cards, ranged)

Lurtz Talent Cards (12)

3x Crippling Shot
A4*, *If Lurtz does damage with this card, the player controlling the defending character cannot draw cards during his/her next turn.

2x Cruel Blade
A5*, *This card may only be used to attack adjacent characters.  If the player controlling the defending character used less than 2 actions during their last turn, the attack value of this card is 8.

1x Savage Shot
A7 – Draw 2 cards.
2x Shield Throw: Lurtz does 2 damage to any character he can attack. Controlling player loses an action on his next turn.

2x Unnatural Speed
Move Lurtz up to 5 spaces.  Draw a card.

1x Alive and Unspoiled
Choose any character adjacent to an Uruk Hai Crossbowman. This character cannot move or attack any character besides the adjacent Uruk Hai until he/she takes damage, or the adjacent Uruk Hai moves.

Notes:  Lurtz could stand to be a tad more powerful in the LOTRED set, as he is sort of the Jango of this group.  He has enough to get it done, but I’d probably raise SAVAGE SHOT to an A9.
Gothmog:
Minor(s): 2 Orc Archers
Back to LOTRED

Gothmog is more representative of the horde army of Orcs rather than any actual character.  However, in the extended version of ROTK, he does some fighting despite his crippled state, and poses a threat to Eowyn.  That stated, then Aragorn shows up and easily cuts his arm off.

GOTHMOG

Gothmog
16 HP
Blue Deck (10 cards, melee)

2x Orc Archers
4 HP Each
Weak Ranged Minor Deck (9 cards, ranged)

Gothmog Talent Cards (12)
3x Orc General
A5*, *Add 1 to the attack value of this card for each of Gothmog’s Orc Archers that may also attack the defending character.

3x Form Ranks
Move Gothmog up to 4 spaces. Then you may move each allied Orc minor to any empty space adjacent to either Gothmog or another Orc minor. Each Orc moves only once.

2x Fire At Will
Each of Gothmog’s Orc Archers do 2 damage to all opponent’s characters they can attack.

2x Time of the Orc
Draw 3 cards. If both Orc Archers are still in play, draw an additional card.

2x They Come By River
Return up to 2 of Gothmog’s destroyed Orc Archers back in play at full health to any empty space adjacent to Gothmog.

20/20 hindsight:  I would have reserved Gothmog for the Armies Expansion and gotten Sharku back into the original, not that it really matters at this point.  Both actually fit the Armies theme and Gothmog is probably a bit more of an actual character, but Sharku is more fun.  Nobody really wants to play an Orc Commander, but he is tailored to be a good teammate to the Witch King, so perhaps he belongs in the starter set after all.

Gollum:
Minor(s): Shelob
Back to LOTRED

Some people really wanted to see Gollum with Smeagol as a dual-personality deck, but I think that sort of unconventional thing is better left to unofficial expansions of this unofficial expansion.  For the base game, I think putting these 2 together was one of my better ideas.

GOLLUM AND SHELOB

Gollum
12 HP
Brown Deck (10 cards, melee)

Shelob
14 HP
Minor Red Deck (9 cards, melee)

Gollum Talent Cards (8)

3x Waylay
Gollum does 2 damage to one character he can attack. Then move Gollum up to 6 spaces. Gollum may move through enemies.

2x Treachery
Choose an opponent. That opponent must choose and discard until he/she has only 5 cards. If Gollum is adjacent to one of that opponent’s characters, he/she must choose and discard until he/she has only 4 cards instead.

2x Deceit
Choose an opponent. You and the chosen opponent draw cards until you both have 8 cards in hand, but no one may draw more than 4 cards.

1x My Preciousss
A7.  Discard your hand.

Shelob Talent Cards (4)
2x Dark Terror
A*/D* Attack and defense values are equal to the number of cards in your hand after playing this card.

1x Stinger
A4. If Shelob does damage with this card, the defending character cannot move and the player controlling the defending character cannot play cards until that player chooses and discards 3 cards.

1x Web
Choose any one character Shelob could attack at a distance. The player controlling this character loses 1 action on his/her next turn and must discard a card at random or 2 cards at random if playing on SHELOB’S LAIR.


Boba Fett & Greedo:

Minor(s): Dengar


What does this deck do:  Massive damage through big attacks and direct damage.  Hits and runs.

“Boba & Dengar”
Modified deck. Original Epic Duels deck by Rob Daviau and Craig Van Ness. Modifications by Geektopia, Dengar inspired by PD Magnus’ original Bounty Hunters decks.

Boba Fett
14 HP
Blaster
19 Cards
Yellow Deck

Dengar
10 HP
Blaster
12 Cards
Strong Ranged Minor Deck

Boba Fett – 9 Talent Cards

3 x ROCKET RETREAT
A4. Move anywhere

2 x WRIST CABLE
2 damage; opponent loses one action on next turn

2 x THERMAL DETONATOR
Inflict 4 damage to one character and 4 damage points to each adjacent character.

1 x KYBER DART
A9. Draw 3 cards if enemy is destroyed

1 x DEADLY AIM
A7. Draw 2 cards

Dengar – 3 Talent Cards

1 x UNCONTROLLED RAGE
A7. Dengar takes 2 damage

1 x GRUDGE
A5. If Han Solo is target, draw 3 cards. If another named character is the target, draw 2 cards.

1 x PAYBACK
D0. Dengar takes full damage, if Dengar survives, attacker takes same amount of damage

Why tweak Boba Fett?  Actually we didn’t do a thing to Boba. We just gave him a minor of closer association in Dengar, with a level of strength commensurate with other personality minors. The change also gives Boba Fett his rightful place as the most powerful ranged deck in the Geektopia universe.

Why break Boba and Greedo up? One advantage of having a set of 40+ decks is that you can make major corrections to the originals, such as splitting up two popular characters so each can star in his own deck with characters he is associated with. Greedo doesn’t even appear in the same movie as Boba Fett, let alone the same scene. Dengar not only appeared in the same scene as Boba Fett, but it was the scene in The Empire Strikes Back where both were originally introduced. Dengar and Boba also have a working relationship in the extended universe. Dengar is probably who Boba should have been with all along, while Greedo should have had his own deck all along, but while there wasn’t enough room for both Dengar and Greedo in a set of 12 decks, there is plenty of room for everyone in a set of 50+.

Tweaks: Dengar replaces Greedo with 10 HP (instead of 7), the same basic cards and 3 new talent cards (listed below):

1x UNCONTROLLED RAGE
A7.  Dengar takes 2 damage.

1x GRUDGE
A5. If Han Solo is target, draw 3 cards. If another named character is the target, draw 2 cards.

1x PAYBACK
D*.  Dengar takes full damage from the attack.  If Dengar is still alive, attacker takes equal damage.

Theme: Big ranged attacks
Path to Victory: Any combination of big offense cards
Strengths: Big ranged attacks, high direct damage, THERMAL DETONATOR changes the way people play you, strong minor, hit-and-run
Weaknesses: Low staying power
Strategy: Use Dengar to deal damage and draw fire early, hit with Boba’s big damage from afar.
Test Level: Very High
Tier: 2

Notes: Boba is not a bad 2v2 player in the original ED with the menace of THERMAL DETONATOR and his arsenal of big attacks but Greedo always weighed him down like a green albatross around his neck. Pairing him with the dangerous Dengar instead of the pathetic Greedo gives Boba a major boost. Dengar is a viable threat who can do damage, draw fire away from Boba, and potentially absorb a fair amount of damage with 10 HP — all the things a personality minor generally does, but that Greedo never really did. Boba retains his unmatched ranged offensive arsenal, a very valuable asset in 2v2, and this is a Tier 1 deck in 3v3. With 2 legitimate ranged threats on the board, these bounty hunters are a nasty, mid-tier duo in any set.


Cave Troll:
Minor(s): 2 Goblins
Back to LOTRED

“They brought a cave troll!”

This is a really fun deck.  He looks tougher than he actually is, at least in 2v2.  In 1v1, he’s a Tier 1 deck without question.  Credit fishfleas with the card name “Drums in the Deep”.

THE CAVE TROLL

Cave Troll
24 HP
Red Deck (10 cards, melee)

2x Moria Goblins
3 HP
Weak Melee Minor Deck (9 cards, melee)

3x Smashing Blow
A8, After attacking, you must choose and discard a card.

3x Battle Frenzy
Cave Troll does 3 damage to all adjacent characters.  Then you may move each affected character up to 2 spaces each.

2x Sweeping Attack
A4*, *After attacking, choose another opposing character adjacent to Cave Troll. Attack that character with this card, and the player controlling the opposing character may defend as normal.

2x Stomp
A4, The defending character cannot move on his/her next turn.

2x Drums in the Deep
You may move Cave Troll up to 3 spaces.  Draw 2 cards.

He’s a multiple enemy smashing berserker with some high damage output.  His defense is as worthless as it gets but his high HP mean he won’t go down early.  DRUMS IN THE DEEP, though, is actually the key to his having a really good game.

Theoden:
Minor(s): 2 Rohirrim Riders
Back to LOTRED

Many directions were considered for Theoden, but the final version was a pretty straightforward one.

Théoden
13 HP
Blue Deck (10 cards, Melee)

2x Rohirrirm
5 HP Each
Minor Blue Deck (9 cards, Melee)

12 Talent Cards Theoden

3x HERUGRIM
A5*. *If this attack is played against a minor character, the attack value is 8.

2x SWORD DAY
A6. The defense card played is reduced by half, rounding down.

2x RED DAY
Theoden does 2 damage and each Rohirrirm adjacent to Theoden does 1 damage to each character he can attack.

2x TO THE KING
Move both Rohirrirm adjacent to Theoden. Theoden recovers 3 damage.

2x MUSTER THE ROHIRRIM
Move Theoden and both Rohirrim up to 4 spaces each. Draw a card.

1x TO WHATEVER END
Before attack is revealed, Theoden may switch places with any allied Rohirrim minor. The minor becomes the target of the attack and may defend.

Notes:  Someone had a Theoden & Eowyn deck in the LOTR Yahoo! group and I thought that might have been the better way to go, but the good side already has a ton of 2-personality decks and if anyone would be bringing an army with him, it’s Theoden.

Legolas:
Minor(s): Gimli
Back to LOTRED

I admit, at first I wanted to split these 2 up and give each his own deck, but wiser heads prevailed.

LEGOLAS AND GIMLI
Legolas
Health 13
Orange Deck (10 cards, ranged)

Gimli
Health 14
Minor Blue Deck (9 cards, melee)

Legolas Talent Cards (6)

3x Competition
A3*, *If the last action played was a COMPETITION card, playing this card does
not count as an action.

2x Bow of the Galadhrim
A5, After attacking, you may move Legolas up to 5 spaces.

1x Side By Side
Move Gimli to any empty space adjacent to Legolas. Playing this card does not
count as an action.

Gimli Talent Cards (5)
3x Competition
A3*, *If the last action played was a COMPETITION card, the attack value of this
card is 6.

1x My Axe is Notched
A7*, *After attacking, if you destroy the defending character, draw 3 cards.

1x Whirling Axes
Move Gimli up to 3 spaces.  Then, Gimli does 2 damage to all characters he can
attack.

Shared Talent Cards (1)

1x Keeping Score
A3/D3*, *Add 1 to the attack or defense value for each COMPETITION card that
has been played this game.

Notes:  This deck is like super fun to play, well balanced, brings out both characters’ personalities, and is probably one of the best designed in the set.  If you want to get started with LOTRED, start here.

Gandalf:
Minor(s): Pippin
Back to LOTRED

The other too-tough deck in this set is Gandalf, but I’ve seen him get his head kicked in by some of the Legends decks.

GANDALF AND PIPPIN

Gandalf
16 HP
Green Deck (10 cards, melee)

Pippin
7 HP
Minor Brown Deck (9 cards, melee)

Gandalf Talent Cards (9)

3x Wielder of the Flame
A6, The player controlling the defending character loses an action on his/her next turn.

2x Staff of Light
STAFF OF LIGHT does 3 damage to all characters Gandalf could attack at a distance.  Move all of these characters up to 3 spaces.

2x You Shall Not Pass
D12, All opponents controlling a character adjacent to Gandalf may not move those characters when
they roll the die to move at the beginning of their next turn.

1x Gandalf The Wise
Choose any opponent. That opponent must reveal his/her hand and discard all Power Attack cards.

1x Shadowfax
Move Gandalf up to 8 spaces.  Then either move Pippin adjacent to Gandalf or draw 2 cards.

Pippin Talent Cards (3)

1x Guard of the Citadel
A6. Draw 2 cards.

1x Longbottom Leaf
You may divide the recovery of up to 3 damage between Pippin and any adjacent allied hobbit.

1x Palantír
Look at the top 4 cards in your draw pile. Place one card in your hand and put the other 3 back in any order.

Suggested Tweak:  I’d probably take STAFF OF LIGHT down to 2 damage.  Gandalf will then struggle a bit to come up with enough damage output, but he’s so incredibly strong in other ways that he could stand to have a slight weakness in addition to the one he already has, which is that he does lose something if Pippin goes down early.

You can leave him as is and have fun playing an incredibly powerful deck that can beat you in many ways.  Like Aragorn, he’s so good that you don’t even have to play very strategically.

Frodo:
Minor(s): Samwise
Back to LOTRED

From what I remember of the LOTRED project, this was by far the hardest deck to get right, and went through several iterations, some pretty different.  There was one version where if Sam died, Frodo started doing massive direct damage with the ring, like he turned evil.  Fishfleas became obsessed that that was the way to depict Frodo and the ring, and basically left the project over my decisions to take those elements away.  Despite all that, I think this final version is a well balanced deck that captures the hobbits well.

FRODO AND SAM

Frodo
12 HP
Brown Deck

Sam
13 HP
Brown+ Minor Deck

Shared Talent Cards (4)

3x Sting
A4. If both Frodo and Sam are adjacent to the target, attack value is 7.

1x Light of Earendil
Search your draw pile for any card and put it in your hand.  At the end of your turn, you may reshuffle your discard pile into your draw pile, including this card.

Frodo Talent Cards (5)

3x The One Ring
Move all characters on the board up to 3 spaces each. If Witch King or any Nazgul are on the board, their controlling players may move each of them up to 3 spaces each.

1x Mithril
D10. Draw a card.

1x The Ring Bearer
A5*. *If Sam has been destroyed, attack value is 9.

Sam Talent Cards (3)

2x For the Shire
A6. If Frodo is adjacent to Sam, move Sam and Frodo up to 6 total spaces.  Otherwise, move Sam up to 6 spaces.

1x Lembas
If any allied hobbits are adjacent to Sam, then Sam and all adjacent allied hobbits each recover up to 3 damage. Otherwise, Sam recovers 4 hit points.

Notes: Lots of tricksy tricks, those hobbits.  It’s actually a powerful deck, were it not for the low HP and weak basic decks.  THE ONE RING, this is the watered-down version, yet it’s a game controller.  Sam can really bring some lumber too.

Faramir:
Minor(s): 2 Archers
Back to LOTRED

This all-ranged deck brings a needed element to LOTRED and is a nice addition to the set.  We were going to include it as part of 14 original decks, but the project was bogging down so this got shelved into the Armies Expansion, not that it really matters now.  Fishfleas did most of the work on this one.

FARAMIR AND 2 GONDORIAN RANGERS

Faramir
HP 15
Orange Deck (10 cards, Ranged, Modified: 5/1 is a 4/1)

2x Gondorian Rangers
HP 4
Strong ranged minor (9 cards, Ranged)

Faramir Talent Cards (12)

3x Ithilian Trap
A4, Add 2 to the attack value for each each Gondorian Ranger that may also attack the defending character and is not adjacent to defending character.

2x Aimed Shot
A5, Draw a card.

1x Valiant Charge
Move each of your characters up to 4 spaces.  Add 2 to the attack value for any attacks you make this turn with a basic card on an adjacent target.  Playing this card does not count as an action.

3x Hidden Pool
Move Faramir up to 4 spaces each.  Then move Gondorian Ranger 1 up to 4 spaces and move Gondorian Ranger 2 up to 4 spaces.  If this card is played as your second action, each character moved recovers up to 2 damage.

2x Lying in Wait
Draw 3 cards.

1x In His Stead
Exchange spaces between Faramir and any allied character.

Note:  The card VALIANT CHARGE is what I call a “fish special:” A convoluted set of effects intended to represent a very specific scene in a very specific way (for another example, see Lurtz’s ALIVE AND UNSPOILED card).  VALIANT CHARGE is actually an extremely powerful card, probably one of the most powerful in LOTRED overall, but I do like it.  The rest of the deck is a straightforward ranged attack deck, which the set needs.

Eowyn:
Minor(s): Merry
Back to LOTRED

This one is straightforward, fun and balanced.

ÉOWYN AND MERRY

Éowyn
15 HP
Red Deck (10 cards, Melee)

Merry
7 HP
Minor Brown Deck (9 cards, Melee)

Éowyn Talent Cards (9)

4x Shield Maiden
A*/D*, *The attack and defense values of this card are equal to the number of cards in your opponent’s hand, not including any attack or defense card just played.

2x Ride With Me
You may move Eowyn up to 3 spaces in a straight line.  Eowyn does 2 damage to all opponent’s characters adjacent to any space in Eowyn’s movement path, including starting and ending spaces.  If Merry is still in play, those characters receive an additional 1 damage.

2x Courage
You may move Éowyn up to 6 spaces. Move Merry to any space adjacent to Éowyn. For each character that moves to a new spot, draw a card.

1x I Am No Man
A5*, *If, after playing this card, you have no cards in your hand, the attack value of this card is 10.

Merry Talent Cards (3)

2x Desperate Strike
A6, After attacking, discard every card in your hand, except one card.

1x Well-Earned Comforts
You may divide the recovery of up to 4 damage between Merry and any adjacent allied hobbit. If no allied hobbits are adjacent to Merry, Merry recovers 3 damage.

20/20 Hindsight:  RIDE WITH ME is too complicated.  Also, this deck is surprisingly strong, but it’s not really overpowered, just maybe a tad better than I wanted it to be.  Mainly, though, I might have put Merry and Pippin with Boromir, and then had Eowyn play minor to Theoden.  This turned out well enough though.  It’s a good deck.

Eomer:
Minor(s): 2 Rohirrim Archers
Back to LOTRED

I actually really love this deck.  It has some clever combinations and can really do something.  At the same time, it can be countered and managed.

ÉOMER, MARSHALL OF THE MARK
by Roman F, art by Robert Moore

Eomer
15 HP
Orange Deck (10 cards, Range)

2x Rohirrirm Archers
5 HP Each
Strong Ranged Minors (9 cards, Ranged)

12 Eomer Talent Cards

3x MARSHAL OF THE MARK
A4. If you do damage with this attack, draw 2 cards.

2x CHARGING ATTACK
A2*. Eomer must be adjacent to play this attack. Add 1 to the attack for each space Eomer has moved from cards this turn.

1x SPEAR THROW
A7. After attacking, you may discard a card to draw a card.

2x RIDE OF THE ROHIRRIM
Choose a direction. Eomer and all adjacent Rohirrim move up to 4 spaces in that direction and move through enemies. Each enemy moved over takes 3 damage and affected players lose an action.

2x FLANKING MANEUVER
Eomer and 1 allied Rohirrim may each move up to 3 spaces. Playing this card does not count as an action.

2x PRE-EMPTIVE STRIKE
D*. Eomer receives no damage from the attack. Return the attack card, unrevealed, to owner’s hand. The attacking character receives 2 damage.

20/20 Hindsight:  Originally, MARSHALL OF THE MARK was called instead WARMONGERER as a tongue-in-cheek joke.  Kinda wish I would have just stuck with that.

Boromir:
Minor(s): Denethor
Back to LOTRED

Fans of Geektopia will recognize that this deck is based off of Quinlan Vos.

BOROMIR AND DENETHOR

Boromir
16 HP
Red Deck (10 cards, melee)

Denethor
10 HP
Minor Brown Deck (9 cards, melee)

Boromir Talent Cards (9)

4x Valor
A4, After attacking, Boromir receives 1 damage.  Playing this card does not count as an action.

1x Blood of Gondor
A*, *The attack value of this card is equal to the amount of damage Boromir has received.

2x Heroic Sacrifice
D2*, *If Denethor has been destroyed, the defense value is 0.  After taking the attacker’s damage, Boromir does 3 points of damage to the attacking character.

2x Horn of Gondor
Boromir recovers 3 damage.  You may move Boromir up to 4 spaces.  Then move Denethor up to 4 spaces.  Then, if Faramir is on the board, move him up to 4 spaces.

Denethor Talent Cards (3)

2x Eyes of the White Tower
Choose any opponent. That opponent must show you all but 2 cards of his/her hand.  Then choose 2 of the cards you can look at.  Your opponent must discard the chosen cards.

1x Gondor Will See It done
You may move Boromir adjacent to any character.  Boromir and that character each receive 3 damage.

20/20 Hindsight:  Yeah, I probably wouldn’t have included Denethor in this way.  I would probably put Boromir with Merry & Pippin and give them 4 cards to bring out their personalities, and made it more of a FOTR deck.  Then, Gandalf would be with Citadel Guards, Eowyn the minor to Theoden the major, and then I would have added in an entirely other deck in the Armies expansion, maybe Galadriel or Haldir or something.

I originally wanted to put Boromir with Faramir but they don’t actually share screen time outside of the extended version, but mainly, Faramir with archers gave LOTRED the rare all-ranged deck, which we kind of needed, so we needed to figure out another direction for Boromir.

I’m really just nitpicking because this is a fun deck.  This is a way to get a character like Denethor in the game because it’s not like anyone would want to play Denethor & 2 Cronies deck or anything.  He’s probably more interesting than a couple of faceless minors and it’s not like he’s out of place as Boromir’s minor, plus he has a spy type of role to play.

Aragorn:
Minor(s): Arwen
Back to LOTRED

The brave hero of Lord of the Rings.  Purists like Ian and Erik don’t like seeing Arwen out there fighting, but this LOTRED set is intended to be the movie version, so she has to be here.

Sultan and Scott Hagarty did the heavy lifting on this design.

ARAGORN AND ARWEN

Aragorn
17 HP
Blue Deck (10 cards, melee)

Arwen
10 HP
Minor Brown Deck (9 cards, melee)

Aragorn Talent Cards (8)

3x Anduril
A6*, *If SHARDS OF NARSIL REFORGED has been played this game, the attack value of this card is 9.

1x There is Always Hope
D10, Search your draw pile for any card. Set that card aside and shuffle the remaining cards in your draw pile. After shuffling, place the chosen card on top of your draw pile.

3x Return of the King
Move all allies in play up to 4 spaces each. Draw a card.

1x Army of the Dead
Choose an opponent. All of that opponent’s characters receive 4 damage.

Arwen Talent Cards (4)

2x Strength of My People
A5, Draw a card.

1x Athelas
Choose one allied character adjacent to Arwen. That character recovers up to 3 damage. If no allied characters are adjacent to Arwen, Arwen recovers up to 3 damage.

1x Shards of Narsil, Reforged
Draw until you have 5 cards in your hand.

Notes:  He’s probably too strong.  Maybe ANDURIL should be A5/A8 or A5/A9 or A6/A8, but A6/A9 with really good defense, plus a strong minor that you want to kill off quickly, plus an appropriately powerful ARMY OF THE DEAD card and… well, he’s probably too strong.  He’s fun, though, and you don’t need to use a lot of strategic thinking to play him well.

Bilbo Baggins:
Minor(s): Kili & Fili
Back to LOTRED

Unlike his nephew, Frodo, Bilbo’s deck revolves around his using the ring.  This deck was updated in January 2020.

Bilbo Baggins
by Roman F
Updated January 2020

Bilbo Baggins
14 HP
Brown Deck
Melee

Kili & Fili
4 HP Each
Strong Ranged Minors
Ranged

3x STING
A4. STING does double any damage, up to 6 total.

3x INVISIBILITY ATTACK
A2*. The defending character may not defend your next attack this turn. If a card with INVISIBILITY in the title is on top of your discard pile, playing this card does not count as an action.

3x INVISIBILITY PROWL
Move Bilbo up to 5 spaces and Bilbo may move through enemies. If a card with INVISIBILITY in the title is on top of your discard pile, playing this card does not count as an action.

1x INVISIBILITY DEFENSE
D*. *Bilbo takes no damage from the attack.  After defending move Bilbo up to any vacant space.

1x MITHRIL
D10. Draw a card.

1x THE BURGLAR
You may search the discard pile for any attack card and put it in your hand.

Notes:  In January 2020 I made 2 changes.

Changed INVISIBILITY ATTACK from an A1 to an A2.  The point is that you can chain them together to get something out of them, not that you necessarily have to combine it with STING, though that’s still an option.
Reduced Kili & Fili from 5 HP each to 4 HP each and it’s an important change.  In LOTRED for strong minors, only mounted warriors get a 5th HP, otherwise they get 4 HP.  I was thinking that Kili & Fili and Balin & Dwalin from the Thorin deck had enough screen time to warrant 5 HP each, but they’re not personality minors; they don’t have their own cards and have to follow the LOTR rules.  It better balances out the Bilbo and Thorin decks anyways.

Eye of Sauron:
Minor(s): Mouth of Sauron
Back to LOTRED

I wasn’t sure about doing this deck at first, but it actually turned out really well.  I was inspired by this Eye in the Tower figure that I have from my old 2000 LOTR game and it works perfectly on the Epic Duels board.  The Mouth of Sauron is Sauron’s servant and emissary and appears in the extended version of Return of the King.  I need to find a figure for him.


Eye of Sauron
20 HP
Green Deck
Melee

Mouth of Sauron
8 HP
Minor Brown
Melee

Eye of Sauron – 8 cards

4x Corruption
Choose a character. That character takes 3 damage, or the player controlling that character discards 3 cards, or any combination up to 3, plus one for each CORRUPTION in your discard pile.

2x Volcanic Eruption
Move all characters adjacent to Eye of Sauron up to 5 spaces each.  Draw a card.

2x Servants of Sauron
A6.  Play face up when attacking.  You may attack any character on the board.

Mouth of Sauron – 4 cards

2x Bid Thee Welcome
A4*.  If this is your first action this turn, attack value is 8.

2x Taunt
A8*.  *The value of any defense card is doubled.


CORRUPTION really powers up the Mouth of Sauron.  You have to kill the Mouth quickly just to have a chance, so I made him intentionally kind of fragile.  It’s not like he shows us anything in ROTK.  The Eye is still a potentially tough customer though.

Smaug:
Minor(s): 2 Fire Pillars
Back to LOTRED

Maybe you’re like, ok, nobody should be able to take on Smaug.  But, people really wanted to see a deck for him, and Robert Moore came up with the idea of Fire Pillars as his minors and the mold for a deck.  Separatist contributed greatly as well and the deck turned out really well.

In 2020, the LOTRED Legend set was created and Smaug suddenly looked a bit lacking, so MY BREATH IS DEATH and DRAGON SCALES were adjusted to increase his power level.

SMAUG THE DRAGON DREAD
by Roman, Robert Moore and Separatist
Updated February 2020

Smaug
23 HP
Melee
Red Deck

2x Fire Pillars
2 HP each
Melee
Weak Ranged Minor Deck (but Melee)

Smaug – 12 Talent Cards

3x My Breath is Death
A9.  Play face up when attacking and you may attack at range.  Place up to 2 Fire Pillars adjacent to the target character, restoring to full health all Fire Pillars including any that were destroyed.

3x Dragonscales
D10*.  *If WEAK SPOT REVEALED is in your discard pile, and a Power Attack is played that would be enough to destroy Smaug, then Smaug is destroyed.

1x My Teeth Are Swords
A4*.  If this attack does damage, attack value is 10.

2x Fiery Explosion
Each Pillar of Fire does 2 damage to each character adjacent to it.  Then remove both Fire Pillars.

2x My Wings a Hurricane
Move Smaug to any open space.  Draw a card.

1x Weak Spot Revealed
You must discard this card as soon as you draw it.  Then draw another card.  This card stays in your discard pile if you
reshuffle.

Notes:  Take him up against SWED decks and let us know how he does!

The Balrog:
The Balrog is a great candidate for a single-character deck.

THE BALROG OF MORGOTH
by JAG and Roman

Balrog
23 HP
Blue Deck + Weak Melee (Geektopia version) Minor deck (19 total cards, Melee)

The Balrog – 17 Talent Cards

3x Durin’s Bane
A6*/D6*.  *After attacking or defending, you may discard a card to do 2 damage to the defending or attacking character, if adjacent.

2x Fire Whip
A7. May attack a target up to 3 spaces away and move target adjacent to Balrog.

1x Fire Sword
A*.  *Attack value is equal to one half the number of cards in your discard pile, rounded down.

2x Foe Beyond Any
All enemies adjacent to Balrog take 3 damage.  You may discard a card to draw a card.

2x Roaring Inferno
Look at the top 5 cards of your draw pile. Put 3 in your hand and discard the rest.

2x Drums in the Deep
Move the Balrog up to 3 spaces.  Draw 2 cards.

Thorin:
Minor(s): 2 Dwarves
Back to LOTRED

This deck is very similar to the Sora Bulq deck for Star Wars, but even more powerful, and in a set that is relatively less powerful.  So, he’s really, really tough, probably too tough.  I love the deck, though.

Thorin Oakenshield
by Roman F
Updated January 2020

Thorin
17 HP
Red Deck
Melee

Balin & Dwalin
4 HP each
Minor Blue Deck
Melee

Talent Cards:

4x RELENTLESS BLADE
A4. After attacking, Thorin may attack the defending character again with a basic attack card without using an action, even when following an OAK SHIELD or if this is your second action.

1x PIERCING BLADE
A5*. If this attack is no blocked, attack value is 9.

2x OAK SHIELD
D3. If the attacking character is adjacent, Thorin may play an attack card on the attacking character without using an action.

3x DWARVEN KING
Move Thorin and all allied Dwarves up to 4 spaces. Draw a card.

2x RUMINATE
Draw 3 cards.

Notes:  In January 2020, I reduced Balin & Dwalin from 5 HP each to 4 HP each and it’s an important change.  In LOTRED for strong minors, only mounted warriors get a 5th HP, otherwise they get 4 HP.  I was thinking that Balin & Dwalin and Kili & Fili from the Bilbo deck had enough screen time to warrant 5 HP each, but they’re not personality minors; they don’t have their own cards and have to follow the LOTR rules.  It better balances out the Thorin and Bilbo decks anyways.

Great Goblin:
Minor(s): 4 Goblins
Back to LOTRED

I think this is a pretty interesting commander deck that doesn’t quite play like anything else out there.

Great Goblin
17 HP
Brown Deck

4x Goblins
3 HP Each
Weak Melee Minors

3x BATTER AND BEAT
All opposing characters adjacent to either the Great Goblin or a Goblin minor takes 2 damage and each affected player discards a card.

3x CRUSH AND SMISH
Move all Goblin minors to an empty space. Then each Goblin minor may do 1 damage to an adjacent enemy major and 1 damage to an adjacent enemy minor.

3x PINCH AND NAB
Move Great Goblin and all Goblin minors up to 3 spaces each.  Opposing players must discard a card for each Goblin minor adjacent to one of their characters.

2x GOBLIN TOWN
Restore a destroyed Goblin minor with full health on the board adjacent to the Great Goblin.

1x RULER OF THE MOUNTAIN
A6*.  *Add 2 to the attack for each Goblin minor on the board.  You must have at least 2 cards in your discard pile to play this card.

Notes:  The Great Goblin was a primary villain in the first of The Hobbit trilogy of films, and his figure was included in a Games Workshop set for the Hobbit with all the other figures.  So while he might not be a top of mind villain, that’s why he’s included, and his deck is fun.
